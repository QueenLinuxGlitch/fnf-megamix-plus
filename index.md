## Friday Night Funkin' MegaMix Plus
### Edited 3/4/21

FNFMM+ is a modpack for [Friday Night Funkin'](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin). Currently, the pack is only built for Windows, but you can use the assets here onm any build of the game. This may be posted on the [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/8694) page for FNF, but currently remains unposted, due to my concerns with the approval process for mods.

:dad:Hey, welcome to the top, hun. You're really good at this!
:bf:Thanks. I didn't know reaching here was so easy. So what next?
:dad:Well, although you're here, it's not worth it. People need to know you're here.
:bf:And how do we do that?
:dad:Well, by recording a battle!
:bf:I don't see anything special in that.
:dad:Oh, you'll see. Follow me.
